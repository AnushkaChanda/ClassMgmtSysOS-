# 📚 Class Management System

## Overview

The **Class Management System (CMS)** is a comprehensive web platform designed to streamline classroom operations and communication. It offers a multi-role environment for students, class representatives (CRs), class administrators (CAs), and system administrators to manage notices, attendance, materials, voting, and more.

Built with a powerful tech stack — **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js** — the CMS ensures a dynamic and responsive user experience. It also supports offline capabilities through **Progressive Web App (PWA)** implementation and is built with scalability and modularity in mind.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Node.js** + **Express.js**: RESTful API development
* **MongoDB**: NoSQL document-based data storage
* **JWT**: Role-based authentication and route protection

### Frontend

* **React.js**: Component-based UI
* **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**
* **Axios**: API requests handling

### Other Tools

* **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 / Google Cloud for media & file uploads
* **PWA Support**: For offline capabilities and installable experience
* **Docker** (Planned): Containerized deployment for all services
* **Microservices Architecture** (Planned): Modular services for scalability

---

## 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)

This project is PWA-enabled, ensuring:

* Offline functionality
* Fast loading times
* Native app-like experience on both desktop and mobile

---

## 🔌 API Development

The backend APIs are developed using Express.js and follow a RESTful pattern. Authenticated routes are protected via JWT, with role-based access control (RBAC) ensuring secure endpoint access.

> Future: Python’s FastAPI may be introduced for AI-powered features like attendance analytics or feedback insights.

---

## 📂 File Management

* Cloud-based file storage using **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**
* CDN integration for faster content delivery
* Secure, private access for authorized users only

---

## 🧠 Smart Automation (Future Scope)

An agent-based system will be integrated to:

* Read WhatsApp messages sent to CRs
* Automatically parse and post content via backend APIs
* Reduce manual overhead and streamline communication

---

## 🐳 Future Enhancements

* **Dockerization**: Container-based deployment for backend, frontend, and services.
* **Microservices**: Refactor system into isolated services for authentication, file management, voting, etc.
* **Real-time Features**: Integration of WebSockets for live updates and notifications.
